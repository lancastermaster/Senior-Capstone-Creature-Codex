# Senior-Capstone-Creature-Codex
The Creature Codex was my Senior Capstone during my time at Sul Ross State University, and was considered to be the most complete capstone that the professor had seen up until that point.

This project is a Windows Form App that functions as a compendium of mythological creatures, taking information read from a .txt file and displaying it in-app in an easy to read format.

This program was built to have five primary functions that the end user could use:

  1.Read Codex - Read Codex is fairly self explanatory. The user is taken to a window where they can see the name, mythology, type, description, and image of the creature. Entries can be cycled through using the Next and Previous buttons, and the user can return to the main screen by clicking on the Home button.

  2.Jump to Entry - Jump to Entry allows you to look at a full list of entries and jump to one you have selected when you click the Jump button.

  3.Search Codex - Search Codex allows you to search for an entry based on a certain parameter that you set via an associated radio button. For example, if you choose to search by name, the Jump to Entry form will pop up, with a list that is filtered of anything that doesn't match that name. If you search by mythology for Greek entries, you will see only Greek entries. The same goes for type.

  4.Create New Entry - Create New Entry allows you to create a custom entry that will then be stored in the .txt file. The image you want displayed can be chosen using the browse files button, which then calls the openFileDialog so you can select the image you want. This feature (Create New Entry) allows the Creature Codex to be used for more than justmythical creatures. If you are a fan of tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons, you could easily use this to store information about any custom monsters you create.

  5.Reset Codex - Reset Codex does just that: it resets the Codex using a backup file that overwrites the main .txt file with the default creatures. Should this take a little bit, a popup will appear and notify the user that the Codex is reseting, and that it may take a few minutes.

What I learned from this:

  1. How to pull information from outside sources and and make use of it in the program.
  2. How to design Windows Forms to be more appealing to the eye and easier to read.
  3. How to analyze the talent and skills available to the group and make the best use of them to deliver a complete, shippable product. This Senior Capstone was a group-based project, and my group was made up three people, one of whom was on a coding-light degree plan. We wanted to create a video game, as we were all originally studying game development, but this was not possible in the time alotted considering the sheer amount of work involved and the fact that I, at the very least, was not as versed in Unity as I wished I was, making such a process even harder. As such, we instead opted to create the Creature Codex, as we could build off of what I learned making a another program (which sadly didn't function quite right) and actually deliver a completed project. 

  I ended up being the primary developer/programmer, while my teammate and friend Orion aided in debugging and keeping me on task. Jim was the team's appointed leader and the man behind all of the documentation that was submitted to the professor.
